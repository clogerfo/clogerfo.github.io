excerpt: "Using GGPlot2 and GGanimate to build an animated bar graph in R"
---

In this post I use GGplot2 and GGanimate in R to build a visualization of coravirus cases by state in the United States. The data begins in March and runs through the first week of November.

The raw data can be found [here](https://covidtracking.com/data/download). The data I used along with my code for these visualizations can be found at the [project's repository](https://github.com/clogerfo/COVID_Visualization). The code for cleaning/preparing the data is included in the R script. 

Below is the visualization. It's a fun project that allows you to get experience with many different facets of ggplot and gganimate while getting a sense for the recent uptick in coronavirus cases in the United States.
